# Web Scraping vs. Web Crawling

**Web scraping** is the process of automatically extracting specific data from a web page. A web scraper typically downloads the HTML of a single page and pulls out the information you want, such as product prices, headlines, or tables.

**Web crawling** is the process of automatically navigating from one web page to another by following links. A web crawler (sometimes called a spider or bot) starts from a given page, finds links on that page, and visits those links, repeating the process to explore many pages across a website or even the entire web.

**Key differences:**
- **Web scraping** focuses on collecting data from specific pages.
- **Web crawling** focuses on discovering and visiting many pages by following links, and can use web scraping techniques to extract data from each page it visits.

In summary, web scraping is about **extracting data**, while web crawling is about **exploring and discovering pages**â€”often combining both to collect information from across a website.
