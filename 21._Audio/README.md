# 21. Audio

This folder demonstrates how to work with audio files on the web. The `index.html` file shows how to use the HTML `<audio>` tag to play an audio file (`floatinggarden.mp3`) from the `assets` folder.

## Key Points

- **Audio as Media:** Audio is a type of media that can be sent and played over the internet, just like images and video.
- **MIME Types:** Audio files use MIME types (like `audio/mp3` or `audio/wav`) so browsers know how to handle and play them.
- **HTML Audio Tag:** The `<audio>` tag in HTML allows you to embed and control audio playback directly in the browser.
- **Practical Example:** This project lets you experiment with playing audio files in the browser, helping you understand how media files are handled and referenced in web development.

Open `index.html` to see how audio playback works in practice.
