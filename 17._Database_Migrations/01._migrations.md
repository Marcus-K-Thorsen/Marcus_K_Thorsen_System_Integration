# What is a migration?

A migration is a way to define and apply changes to a database in a structured and systematic manner. Instead of manually writing and executing SQL scripts, migrations allow developers to manage database changes programmatically, ensuring consistency and version control.

Migrations are particularly useful for:
- Keeping the database schema in sync with the application code.
- Applying changes across multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- Rolling back changes if something goes wrong.

There are two main types of migrations, which serve different purposes in database management. These will be explained in the next section.

# Two Types of Migrations

Migrations are categorized into two main types, each serving a distinct purpose in database management:

1. **Schema Migration (DDL)**:
   - Schema migrations involve changes to the structure of the database, such as creating, altering, or dropping tables and columns.
   - These migrations are essential for evolving the database schema as application requirements change, ensuring the database structure stays in sync with the codebase.
   - **DDL** stands for *Data Definition Language*, which refers to SQL commands like `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP` that define or modify the database schema.

2. **Data Migration / Seeding (DML)**:
   - Data migration typically refers to moving data from one database to another, such as during a database upgrade or migration to a new system.
   - Seeding, on the other hand, is the process of populating a database with initial data, often for testing, development, or setting up default values in a new database.
   - **DML** stands for *Data Manipulation Language*, which refers to SQL commands like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` that manipulate the data within the database.

### Why Are They Both Called Migrations?

Although schema migrations and data migrations serve different purposes, they are both referred to as "migrations" because they involve making changes to the database. Whether you're modifying the structure or the data, migrations provide a systematic way to apply and track these changes over time.

# Schema Migration (DDL)

Schema migrations involve changes to the structure of the database, such as creating, altering, or dropping tables and columns. They are essential for evolving the database schema as application requirements change, ensuring the database structure stays in sync with the codebase.

## Benefits of schema migrations

**What are the benefits of creating database migrations?**

### Answer:
Database migrations provide a structured and version-controlled way to manage changes to the database schema. They allow developers to:
- Easily apply schema changes across environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- Track and document changes to the database over time.
- Rollback changes if something goes wrong, ensuring stability.
- Collaborate effectively by sharing schema updates with the team.

Migrations act as a "version control system" for the database, making it easier to maintain and evolve the database schema in a consistent and reliable way.

* You can easily setup a new database from scratch.

* You can automatically apply a migration to the production database through your pipelines when you deploy.

* You can propagate changes to the schema to other developers. It's basically version control for databases.

* You can easily rollback a migration if something goes wrong.

# Data Migration: Seed Data (DML)

Seeding is the process of populating a database with initial data. This is useful for setting up default values, testing, or creating an initial state for your application.


## Benefits of seeding

**In what case would seeding a `users` table make sense?**

### Answer:
Seeding a `users` table is useful in the following scenarios:

1. **Creating Default Admin Users**:
   - When setting up a new application, you may need to create an admin user with elevated privileges to manage the system.

2. **Populating the Database with Test Data**:
   - During development or testing, seeding can provide sample users to simulate real-world scenarios.

3. **Setting Up Default Roles and Permissions**:
   - You can seed users with predefined roles (e.g., admin, editor, viewer) to ensure the application has a basic structure for access control.

4. **Providing Initial Data for Demos**:
   - Seeding allows you to populate the database with example users for demonstration purposes.

<details> 
  <summary>Example</summary>
  - Admin user: `admin@example.com` with full privileges.
  - Regular users: `user1@example.com`, `user2@example.com` with limited access.
</details>

# Getting started


## Create the `.env` file

```bash
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword  # Root password for MySQL
MYSQL_DATABASE=mydatabase         # Name of the database to create
MYSQL_USER=myuser                 # Username for the database (mydatabase)
MYSQL_PASSWORD=myuserpassword     # Password for the user (myuser)
MYSQL_HOST=localhost              # Host for the MySQL server
MYSQL_PORT=3305                   # Port for the MySQL server
```

---

## Create the `docker-compose.yaml` file

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: mysql:latest
    container_name: mysql_system_integration_migrations_container
    env_file:
      - .env
    ports:
      - "${MYSQL_PORT}:3306"
    environment:
      - MYSQL_HOST=${MYSQL_HOST}
    volumes:
      - system_integration_db_migrations_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  system_integration_db_migrations_data:

```

Then run it:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

---

## [Optional] See if you can connect through the terminal
    
```bash
$ docker ps
$ docker exec -it <container_id> mysql -u myuser -p mydatabase
```

When prompted enter the password: myuserpassword

List databases (we don't have any tables in `mydatabase` yet):

```sql
SHOW DATABASES; # list databases
SHOW TABLES;    # list tables
```
