## Getting started

SQLAlchemy is a Python SQL tookit and ORM. Alembic is a tool for creating migrations. 

```bash
$ poetry init -n
$ poetry add alembic sqlalchemy mysqlclient
$ poetry run alembic init alembic
$ poetry shell
```

## Configuration

Update the `alembic.ini` with the database connection information. Example for MySQL:

```ini
sqlalchemy.url = mysql+mysqldb://user:password@localhost/dbname
```

If you are connecting to MySQL in Docker, ensure the mysqlclient library is properly installed and configured. Remember to have the mysql database running from the docker-compose.yaml file. 
Adjust the port as needed:

```ini
sqlalchemy.url = mysql+mysqldb://root:rootpassword@127.0.0.1:3305/mydatabase
```

## Creating a migration

```bash
$ alembic revision -m "create account table"
```

Update the file with the migration code from the documentation. But let's pluralize the table name to `accounts`:

https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#create-a-migration-script

```python
def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        'accounts',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(50), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('description', sa.Unicode(200)),
    )

def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('accounts')
```

## Running the migration

```bash
$ alembic upgrade head
```

Rollback the migration:

```bash
$ alembic downgrade -1
```

## Seeding

### Seeding in the `upgrade` Function
Define the upgrade function as the following:

```python
def upgrade():
    accounts_table = op.create_table(
        'accounts',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('name', sa.String(50), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('description', sa.Unicode(200)),
    )
    op.bulk_insert(accounts_table,
    [
        {'id': 1, 'name': 'John Smith', 'description': 'CEO'},
        {'id': 2, 'name': 'Ed Williams', 'description': 'CTO'},
        {'id': 3, 'name': 'Wendy Jones', 'description': 'CFO'},
    ])
```

In Alembic, seeding is often done directly within the `upgrade` function of a migration file. This ensures that the initial data is inserted into the database as part of the migration process. This approach is different from the Node.js Knex project, where seeding is handled in a separate seed file.

### Why is Seeding Done in the `upgrade` Function?

1. **Tightly Coupled with Schema Changes**:
   - In Alembic, migrations are designed to handle both schema changes and data changes together. By including the seed data in the `upgrade` function, you ensure that the data is inserted immediately after the schema is created. This avoids potential issues where the schema exists but the data is missing.

2. **Version Control**:
   - Alembic migrations are version-controlled, meaning each migration file corresponds to a specific state of the database. Including seed data in the migration ensures that the database is in a consistent state when the migration is applied.

3. **Rollback Support**:
   - By including the seed data in the `upgrade` function and removing it in the `downgrade` function, you can fully reverse the migration if needed. This is particularly useful in development or testing environments where you might need to roll back changes.

4. **Simplified Workflow**:
   - Since Alembic does not have a built-in concept of separate seed files like Knex, including the seed data in the migration file simplifies the workflow. You donâ€™t need to manage separate files for schema and data changes.


### Comparison with Node.js Knex

In the Node.js Knex project, seeding is handled in a separate seed file. This approach has its own advantages:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Schema changes and data changes are handled in separate files, making it easier to manage large projects.
- **Reusable Seed Files**: Seed files can be re-run independently of migrations, which is useful for populating test data multiple times.

However, this separation also means that you need to ensure the seed files are run after the migrations, which requires additional coordination.

### When to Use Each Approach

- **Alembic (Python)**: Use the `upgrade` and `downgrade` functions for seeding when the seed data is tightly coupled with the schema changes or when you want to ensure version control and rollback support.
- **Knex (Node.js)**: Use separate seed files when you want to keep schema and data changes independent or when you need to re-run seed files multiple times.
